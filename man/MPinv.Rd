\title{Moore-Penrose Generalized Inverse of a Matrix}
\usage{
MPinv(X, tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps))
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{(object) two-dimensional, for which a Moore-Penrose inverse 
has to be computed}

\item{tol}{(numeric) tolerance value to be used in comparisons}
}
\value{
(object) A Moore-Penrose inverse of X.
}
\description{
This function is originally implemented in package 'MASS' as function 
\code{ginv}.  
It was adapted to be able to deal with matrices from the 'Matrix' package, 
e.g. sparse matrices.
