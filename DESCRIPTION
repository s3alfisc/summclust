Description: Module to compute cluster robust covariance matrices (CRV3 and 
        CRV3J) and cluster specific information for regression models
        with clustered errors, including leverage and influence statistics. 
        Models of type 'lm' and 'fixest'(from the 'stats' and 'fixest' packages)
        are supported. 'summclust' implements similar features as the 
        user-written 'summclust.ado' Stata module (MacKinnon, Nielsen & Webb, 2022; 
        <arXiv:2205.03288v1>).
